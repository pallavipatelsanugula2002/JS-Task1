    <p>In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement 
        that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.
         The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.</p>
         <p>The while construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression.
            The condition/expression is evaluated, and if the condition/expression is true,
             the code within all of their following in the block is executed. 
             This repeats until the condition/expression becomes false.
              Because the while loop checks the condition/expression before the block is executed, 
              the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop. Compare this with the do while loop,
               which tests the condition/expression after the loop has executed.</p>

            </h1>

            <p>a for-loop or for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration. 
                Specifically, a for loop functions by running a section of code repeatedly until a certain condition has been satisfied.

                For-loops have two parts: a header and a body. The header defines the iteration and the body is the code that is executed
                 once per iteration. The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable. This allows the body to know which
                  iteration is being executed. For-loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. 
                For-loops can be thought of as shorthands for while-loops which increment and test a loop variable.</p>

                <p>In JavaScript, the if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
                     If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed using the else statement. 
                    The else if statement is used to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.</p>
